    <p> 
        I have always been passionate about technology, problem solving being my favourite aspect of it. The idea that I create something may impact someone across the globe now or in the future, is the reason I choose to be in Tech. I love builing projects that have a real-life impact and I'm always open to new opportunities that help me learn, grow and expand my horizons.
